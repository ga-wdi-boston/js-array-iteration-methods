# JavaScript Array Iteration Methods

## Prerequisites

-   [JavaScript Functions "Ins & Outs"](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-functions-ins-and-outs)

## Objectives

By the end of this talk, developers should be able to:

-   Write callbacks to pass to array methods
-   Write functions to emulate array methods
-   Write functions using array methods to add functionality.

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
 [FAQ](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Checkout to the `training` branch.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Callbacks

A callback is a function that we pass as an argument to another function or
method.  This other function invokes the callback as a necessary part of
accomplishing its task.  The JavaScript Array Iteration Methods require callback
functions.

We often use predicate functions, functions returning either `true` or `false`, as callbacks.

## Arrow Functions

We frequently use `arrow` (sometimes referred to as `fat arrow`) functions
as callbacks.  This is convenient when the callback is anonymous.

Although the following is true of arrow functions:

```js
> typeof () => {}
'function'

> () => {} instanceof Function
true
```

There are a few caveats.

Arrow functions:

-   cannot use
    [`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
    (trying generates: `ReferenceError: arguments is not defined`).
-   **cannot** be used as a Constructor (`new` does not bind `this`, no
    `prototype` property).
-   always have a lexically bound `this` (we'll learn more about that later).

## Array Iteration Methods

We'll explore the array methods that allow us to test and transform arrays more
simply and consistently, [Iteration
methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods),
and we'll model some of these JavaScript Array methods as functions.

We'll check our work in `node` or using the scripts in `bin/`.

### Demo: modeling and using `forEach`

The
[forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)
method iterates over all of the elements in an array. Unlike a `for` loop, it
cannot be stopped (all elements are processed).  `forEach` returns `undefined`.

From the MDN documentation:

    There is no way to stop or break a forEach() loop other than by throwing an
    exception. If you need such behavior, the forEach() method is the wrong
    tool, use a plain loop instead. If you are testing the array elements for a
    predicate and need a Boolean return value, you can use every() or some()
    instead. If available, the new methods find() or findIndex() can be used for
    early termination upon true predicates as well.

This means that `forEach` is a poor choice for an operation on an array that may
terminate early.

### Code along: modeling and using `map`

The
[map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
method returns a **new** array the same size as the existing array.  The
elements of the new array are set to the return value of the callback passed to
`map` invoked with the corresponding element from the original array as its
argument (e.g. `newArray[i] = callback(array[i])`).  The array `map` is called
upon is **not** mutated.

Because `map` must access all of the elements of the array, we'll implement our
model of it in terms of `forEach`.

After we build our version of `map`, we'll test and compare it against the built
in version.

### Annotate along: modeling and using `reduce`

The
[reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
method returns a single value from operating on all the values in the array.  It
"reduces" many to one. The original array does not change.

Because `reduce` must access all of the elements of the array, our
implementation uses `forEach`.

The key to **using** `reduce` properly is to methodically walk-through the
"How reduce works" section at the above link.

After we build our version of `reduce`, we'll test and compare it against the
built in version.

### Lab: modeling and using `filter`

The
[filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
method returns a **new** array containing elements from the original array for
which the callback returns `true`.  The length of the new array may be 0, the
callback returned `false` for every element, or equal to the length of the
original array, the callback returned `true` for every element in the original
array.

Callbacks passed to `filter` should be predicate functions.

### Demo: modeling and using `findIndex`

The
[findIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)
method returns the index of the first element in the array for which the
callback returns true.

Why do we need `findIndex`?  Why not just use
[indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)?

### Code along: modeling and using `find`

The
[find](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
method returns the first element in the array for which the callback returns
true.

Can we build `find` using `findIndex`?

### Code along: modeling and using `some`

The
[some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some)
method return true if the callback returns `true` for any element of the array.

Callbacks passed to `some` should be predicate functions.

Can we build `some` using `findIndex`?

### Lab: modeling and using `every`

The [every](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every)
method checks to see if all elements of the array meet some test.  The function
used for this should only return `true` or `false`.  This type of function is
often called a predicate.

Callbacks passed to `every` should be predicate functions.

Can we build `every` using `findIndex`?  Using `some`?

### Lab: modeling and using `reduceRight`

The [reduceRight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduceRight)
method is functionally equivalent to using `reduce` on the array returned by
the `reverse` JavaScript Array method.

Hint:  Start by writing `forEachRight` (similar to forEach but iterating from
the last element (at index `length-1`) through the first (at index 0).

How would the results of calling `reduceRight` differ from calling `reduce`?
